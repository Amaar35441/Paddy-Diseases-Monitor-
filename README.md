<h2>### Paddy Disease Monitoring System 🌾<h2>
This repository contains the code and documentation for my Final Year Project (FYP): Paddy Disease Monitoring System. The goal of this project is to leverage machine learning and computer vision to assist farmers in identifying paddy diseases early, improving crop yield and reducing losses.

<h2>🚀 Project Highlights</h2>
🟢 <b>Objective:</b> Develop a mobile application capable of detecting paddy diseases using advanced deep learning models.

🟢 <b>Key Features:</b>

🌟 <b>Image-based disease detection</b> for paddy crops.

🌟 <b>User-friendly mobile app</b> built with <i>Flutter</i> for seamless interaction.

🌟 <b>Efficient and accurate classification</b> using state-of-the-art hybrid deep learning models.
